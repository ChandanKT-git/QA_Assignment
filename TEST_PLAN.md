## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1 Test Levels
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interaction testing
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Acceptance Testing**: UAT with stakeholders

### 5.2 Testing Techniques
- Black Box Testing
- Positive/Negative Testing
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Equivalence Partitioning
- Error Guessing

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Browser compatibility issues | High | Medium | Test on multiple browsers early |
| Performance degradation with large cart | Medium | Low | Implement pagination/lazy loading |
| Payment gateway failures | High | Low | Implement proper error handling |
| Mobile responsiveness issues | High | Medium | Test on multiple viewports |
| Data validation vulnerabilities | Critical | Medium | Implement input sanitization |
